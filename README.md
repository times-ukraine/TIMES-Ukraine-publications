Abstract: The TIMES-Ukraine energy system model is used to explore the future of nuclear power plants (NPPs) under an ambitious climate policy scenario, achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions in 2050. Varying techno-economic (construction costs and capacity factors for NPPs, capital costs for solar and wind), policy (ban on construction or extension of NPPs), and macroeconomic (alternative economic recovery trajectories) factors are considered. The difference in the techno-economic assumptions for nuclear power generation has a very moderate impact on the total system costs (TSC) of the energy transition, as their variation (positive or negative change) does not exceed 0.1%–0.2% relative to the default case. Policy decisions on restricting nuclear power generation could have a more substantial impact, as TSC increase by 4–5 billion USD (0.6%–0.9%) over the 2020–2050 period under the most restrictive case. In terms of the economic viability of various NPPs, we find small modular reactors to be more competitive than large NPPs due to the higher availability factor. Overall, in terms of developing new NPP capacities, policymakers can consider alternative futures for this technology without major implications for the energy transition costs, as retired NPPs can be substituted by alternative generation technologies in a cost-competitive manner.

Abstract: The development of renewable energy sources (RES) is considered to be a key instrument in addressing climate change. However, different RES have different potential and economic feasibility depending on country-specific conditions and mitigation ambitions. Understanding the relative importance of each RES could help policymakers focus their efforts on the most promising options. In this paper, we focus on Ukraine and explore the potential of biomass use under two mitigation scenarios – with 68% and 83% of greenhouse gas emissions reduction in 2050 relative to the 2010 level. First, using the TIMES-Ukraine energy system model, we show that biomass would play a major role in the future climate mitigation. If constrained at the baseline scenario level (due to political or other reasons), mitigation costs would be substantially higher – by 14.0–19.6 B € or 10.8–14.3 €/tCO2-eq., over the 2020–2050 time frame. Second, we quantify the importance of each biomass source. We show that woody biomass and bioliquids are the most important biofuels under the high-ambition climate scenario, while biowaste and bioliquids play a key role in the lower ambition pathway. Finally, we analyse the current policy environment in the context of future biomass development and conclude with a set of policy recommendations toward the realization of the biomass potential in Ukraine. We believe that findings presented in the paper would be relevant not only for supporting the decision-making process in Ukraine, but could also provide useful insights for other countries with similar conditions.
